# image2sgf
Converts an image to an SGF

To use this program properly, please download cgoban (sgf editor). You can use other sgf editors as well, but you'll need to change the path to the exe file 
(it's currently set to cgoban)

To run the program, open image2sgfFinal.py and run it. 

The loaded image has to be 915x921 pixels and (on a 1920 x 1080 monitor?) to work because the intersections are in fixed locations based on my screen setup.  
You can use my screenshot script (https://github.com/ScriabinOp8No12/screenshot_script) to take a perfect screenshot for this program.
